## General Info
The Martin Bug Net offers all the same features and easy setup as our original Warbler Bug Net, with an extra foot of length. Weighing only 5.85 oz (166 g,) the Martin Bug Net provides full 360-degree protection from mosquitos, flies, and all the other annoying bugs. Incredibly thin, lightweight, and amazingly durable 0.6 oz No-See-Um netting and reinforced ends ensure years of reliable use and a consistent seal to keep even the smallest bugs out of your personal bubble. It can be used in combination with our rain tarps.

Get some no compromises, extra length to keep longer hammocks completely covered with the Martin Bug Net.
